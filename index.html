        <h1>What is a hackathon?</h1>
        <p>
          A hackathon is an event where programmers meet to create something
          that solves a problem. At our Virtual Hackathon, you and your friends
          will come up with a project and actually build it, with the help and
          guidance of other participants. You'll walk away with a working app,
          website or gadget, as well as invaluable programming experience!
        </p>
        <p>
          The hackathon is open to students grades 8-12 in Tyngsborough and
          surrounding towns, and will run on Wednesdays from 2:30-4:00 starting
          February 3.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h1>Do I need to know how to code?</h1>
        <p>
          Programming experience is encouraged but not required — students of
          all experience levels are welcomed. Be prepared to share what you know
          and ask lots of questions! The host, Wilson Gramer, will be available
          at any time for help.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h1>What else do I need?</h1>
        <p>
          The Virtual Hackathon will take place over Google Meet (the link will
          be sent to attendees before it starts). You need a computer running
          Windows or macOS (a Chromebook is suitable for websites but not app
          development). You don't need to install any software prior to the
          hackathon — Wilson will aid in getting everything set up for you.

        <h1>About Wilson Gramer</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a junior at Tyngsborough High School with a passion for
          programming. I have two apps on the App Store, I'm the lead programmer
          on our robotics team, and I love to tinker and experiment. I'm hosting
          this hackathon as a place for me and other student programmers to
          exchange our experiences and build things together!
        </p>
        <p>
          I am primarily experienced with iOS, server-side development with
          TypeScript, and building countless little tools to help with everyday
          tasks. Currently I'm creating my own programming language that I plan
          to use to teach newcomers.
